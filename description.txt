Sick of farming for Dark & Light Shards? Yeah same, so instead of taking the time to grind out the Shards I made this mod so you can craft them, and convert one to the other!

This is a very light mod, since it only contains a couple recipes (Hell, the biggest file in the mod is the icon :shrug:), so it'll run with very, *very* minimal performance decrease (aka none).

Recipes:
 - 1 Light Shard
  • 15 Pearlstone Blocks
  • 15 Purity/Hallowed Sand
  • 3 Pixie Dust
  @ a Mythril Anvil

 - 1 Dark Shard (Crimson Variant)
  • 15 Crimstone Blocks
  • 15 Crimsand 
  • 3 Vertebrae
  @ a Mythril Anvil

 - 1 Dark Shard (Corruption Variant)
  • 15 Ebonstone Blocks
  • 15 Ebonsand 
  • 3 Rotten Chunks
  @ a Mythril Anvil

 - 2 Light Shards to 2 Dark Shards
  • 2 Light Shards
  • 1 Evil Spreader (e.g. Red Solution, Vile Water, Vicious Powder, etc.)

Have fun not having to grind for these :)
